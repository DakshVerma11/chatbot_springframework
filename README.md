# AI e-Aushadhi and e-Upkaran Chat-bot Assistant

A Spring Framework-based intelligent chatbot system designed to provide support for e-Aushadhi and e-Upkaran services. This application features a real-time chat interface, administrative dashboards, and comprehensive query logging.

## Overview

This chatbot assistant is built using Java Spring Framework with a multi-tier architecture that separates presentation, business logic, and data persistence. It uses WebSockets for real-time communication and incorporates voice recognition capabilities for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

### End-User Features

* Interactive chat interface with text and voice input options
* Real-time response generation based on keyword matching
* Voice-to-text functionality using Web Speech API
* Responsive and draggable chat window

### Administrative Features

* Comprehensive CRUD operations for managing chatbot responses
* Intuitive admin dashboard for knowledge base management
* Query log analytics dashboard with search and filtering capabilities
* Statistical overview of user interactions

## Technology Stack

### Backend

* **Framework**: Java Spring Boot
* **Data Persistence**: Spring Data JPA & Hibernate
* **Database**: MySQL
* **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket & STOMP protocol

### Frontend

* **Templating Engine**: Thymeleaf
* **Core Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5
* **Voice Input**: Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition)

## System Architecture

The application follows an N-Tier architectural pattern with:

### Presentation Layer

* Renders UI and captures user input
* Server-side rendering via Thymeleaf for admin views
* Client-side rendering for chat interface

### Business Logic Layer

* Core application logic in Spring `@Service` classes
* Request processing and data operation orchestration

### Data Persistence Layer

* Database interactions using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
* Connection to MySQL database

### Communication Model

* **REST (HTTP)**: For administrative CRUD operations and analytics
* **WebSockets**: For real-time chat interface with low-latency, bidirectional communication

## Data Models

### Entity Relationship

The database schema consists of two primary entities:

* `chatbot_data`: Stores the chatbot's knowledge base (keywords, responses, hyperlinks)
* `query_log`: Records user interactions (user ID, IP address, query text, timestamp)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK 11 or higher
* Maven
* MySQL Server

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DakshVerma11/chatbot_springframework.git
   cd chatbot_springframework
   ```

2. **Configure the database**

   * Create a MySQL database named `chatbot_db`
   * Update `application.properties` with your database credentials

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/chatbot_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

3. **Build and run the application**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the application**

   * Chatbot interface: `http://localhost:8080/`
   * Admin dashboard: `http://localhost:8080/admin`
   * Query logs: `http://localhost:8080/querylogs`

### Query Log Dashboard

Analytics dashboard showing user interaction statistics, helping administrators track the chatbot's performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Core Components

### Backend Logic Flow

The chatbot's response generation follows this process:

1. User submits a query
2. `ChatbotService` processes the message
3. `KeywordMatcher` utility finds potential matches in the knowledge base
4. If multiple matches found, one is randomly selected
5. If no match found, a default message is returned
6. Query is logged for analytics

### Real-time Communication

WebSocket communication is handled through:

* `WebSocketController`: Routes messages using STOMP protocol
* Client-side JavaScript for connection management and message handling

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with NLP services for improved query understanding
* Multi-language support
* User authentication and personalized responses
* Machine learning model to improve response accuracy over time
